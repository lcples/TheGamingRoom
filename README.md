# TheGamingRoom

The Gaming Room wants to create a we-based game that can be played on multiple platforms based on their current game "Draw It or Lose It." The game requires individual game instances, the ability to have one or more teams, the ability to assign multiple players to a team, and input validation for names to ensure they are unique. 

In this document I did a good job at comparing and contrasting different platforms. I took a lot of time finding their pros, cons, and similarities.

Working through a design document helped me understand that interpreting communication from a client properly will be an important skill I will need to work on to become an effective programmer.

I would revise the recommendations part of the document. Without much practice or particular expertise, I found it was hard to find the write recommendations with good explanations. I believe this is something that I will develop as I progress,

I really focused on the web-based requirement and on how Linux was the ideal choice to run a server. The specific user needs are integral to how the game plays and how the client wants the game to be produced. If these are not met the client will not be satified with the product.

My approach soley focused on the information the client relayed. In the future I plan to be less narrow minded and do more research for a better understanding of what the client wants.
